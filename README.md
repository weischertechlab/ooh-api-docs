# ooh-api-docs

A documentation site made with Material for MkDocs.

Lookup [Material for MkDocs Getting started Guide](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) on how to install and run it on your machine.

When everything is setup, you should have a python environment folder like "mkdocs-env" on your system. To startup the python environment,
navigate into the environment folder and run the Activate.ps1 script:

```.\mkdocs-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1```

This creates the required python environment. After that you can navigate into the ooh api docs folder and start the local dev server:

```mkdocs serve```

After successful start you can navigate to the site: http://localhost:8000/
